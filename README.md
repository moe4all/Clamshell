Mini-CLAN on python

This project is to parse CHAT file on CHILDES at https://childes.talkbank.org/ so that further analysis can be made via self-defined python script.

This is a beta version containing the basic parser only, while more functions and documentations are on the way. 

If you need to use this in research/further development, please cite this repository. Thank you.
